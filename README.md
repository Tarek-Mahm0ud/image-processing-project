## Image-Processing Project with Bmplib Library
## Overview
Welcome to the Image-Processing project powered by C++ and the powerful Bmplib library! This project focuses on filtering image-processing techniques to enhance and transform images in various creative ways.

# Features
-Black & White Transformation:

Description: Transforms an ordinary image into a classic black & white version.
Usage: ./image_processor -bw input_image.bmp output_image.bmp
Error Diffusion Dithering:

Description: Adds artistic flair through advanced dithering techniques.
Usage: ./image_processor -dither input_image.bmp output_image.bmp
Invert & Merge:

Description: Flips perspectives with inverted images or merges two visual tales into one.
Usage: ./image_processor -invert_merge input_image1.bmp input_image2.bmp output_image.bmp
Picture Flip & Rotate:

Description: Turns things around! Rotation and flipping for a dynamic view.
Usage: ./image_processor -flip_rotate input_image.bmp output_image.bmp
Light & Dark Adjustment:

Description: Adjusts the ambiance with picture lightening and darkeningâ€”mastering the art of contrast.
Usage: ./image_processor -light_dark input_image.bmp output_image.bmp
Enlarge & Shrink:

Description: Plays with dimensions! Enlarges and shrinks images for a closer look or a broader perspective.
Usage: ./image_processor -enlarge_shrink input_image.bmp output_image.bmp
Edge Detection:

Description: Unleashes the power to detect and highlight picture edges! Sharpens the focus.
Usage: ./image_processor -edge_detection input_image.bmp output_image.bmp
Note: This version is only compatible with 256x256 grayscale images.
